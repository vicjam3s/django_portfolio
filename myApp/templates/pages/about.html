    <h3> As a Developer</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working across the full stack with a strong focus on
      backend logic, clean architecture, and maintainable code.
    </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h3> Design Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      I care deeply about how applications feel to use — clarity,
      spacing, and visual balance matter.

  <section class="about-section">
    <h3> Beyond Code</h3>
    <p>
      Aviation has shaped my thinking around discipline, precision,
      and decision-making — values I bring into software development.
