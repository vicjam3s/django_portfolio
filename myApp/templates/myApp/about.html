  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p class="lead">
    I’m Victor James — a software developer with a passion for building
    systems that are reliable, readable, and genuinely useful.
  </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h3> As a Developer</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working across the full stack, with a strong focus on
      backend logic, clean architecture, and maintainable code.
      Python and Django are my core tools, but I value understanding
      how frontend design and user experience shape great software.
    </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h3> Design Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      I care deeply about how applications feel to use.
      Layout, spacing, colour, and clarity matter — even in
      technical systems. I aim to build interfaces that are calm,
      intuitive, and human.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h3> Outside Code</h3>
    <p>
      Alongside software development, I have a strong interest in aviation.
      Aviation has shaped how I think about discipline, precision,
      and decision-making — values I bring directly into my work as a developer.
